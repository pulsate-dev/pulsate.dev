# About Pulsate

Pulsate is a distributed social networking project that started in 2023.

We aim to create a **fast, developer and user-friendly ActivityPub implementation** that can serve as an alternative to existing distributed SNSs.

  The name was originally **Salata**, but was changed to **Pulsate** when the
  project became independent. The name **Pulsate** comes from the album
  "PULSATE" by indigo la End, a favorite band of the team leader,
  [m1sk9](https://github.com/m1sk9).

## What we want to work on

The Pulsate Project is primarily interested in:

1. Development of software to incorporate existing user communities.
2. It is provided free of charge, is publicly available and developed on GitHub, and is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
3. Design for extensibility to allow users to customize the system as they wish.
4. Design UI/UX so that users who have used Misskey, Mastodon, etc. can use it without problems.

## Problem to be solved

The issues we want to solve with the Pulsate Project are as follows.

- Provide user-friendly UI/UX (lack of context for errors, accessibility issues)
- Fundamental development methodology issues (Lack of documentation, unclear API. Heavy use of `any` types, etc.)

## Philosophy

Next-generation distributed SNS that **"redefines"** people's connections.

### Redefining People's Connections

Pulsate rethinks the way people share information and communicate easily.
Using ActivityPub and other distributed technologies, Pulsate will create a fairer and more open digital space where people from all over the world can freely connect and express themselves.

### Strengthening the developer community

In the spirit of open source, we will create a system that facilitates developers' participation in development, improve documentation, and manage the community.

### We don't put in anything extra.

We emphasize user-centered design. We provide only what is necessary and avoid bothering the user with superfluous features and information.
We aim not only for simple and intuitive usability, but also for quick and easy access to the information users seek.
