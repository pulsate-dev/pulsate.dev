# About Pulsate

Pulsate is a distributed social networking project that started in 2023.

We aim to create a **fast, developer and user-friendly ActivityPub implementation** that can serve as an alternative to existing distributed SNSs.

## What we want to work on

The Pulsate Project is primarily interested in:

1. Development of software to incorporate existing user communities.
2. It is provided free of charge, is publicly available and developed on GitHub, and is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
3. Design for extensibility to allow users to customize the system as they wish.
4. Design UI/UX so that users who have used Misskey, Mastodon, etc. can use it without problems.

## Problem to be solved

The issues we want to solve with the Pulsate Project are as follows.

- Provide user-friendly UI/UX (lack of context for errors, accessibility issues)
- Fundamental development methodology issues (Lack of documentation, unclear API. Heavy use of `any` types, etc.)

## History

The Pulsate Project was launched in September 2023 in a student community. It was initially developed within the community, but in November 2023, it became independent from the community and became a single project.

The source code of Pulsate is available on [GitHub](https://link.pulsate.dev/github) and anyone can participate in its development.

  The name was originally **Salata**, but was changed to **Pulsate** when the project became independent.
  The name **Pulsate** comes from the album "PULSATE" by indigo la End, a favorite band of the team leader, [m1sk9](https://github.com/m1sk9).
