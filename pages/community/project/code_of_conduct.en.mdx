## Core Value

> *Every relationship conflict is due to a lack of humility, respect, and trust  
> --- Team Geek -How Google Geeks Build Teams*.

### 1. Humility

Your technical skills are great and you may always be the envy of those around you.

However, you may not always make the right choices.

Other contributors are just as eager to improve their products.

Remember to be flexible and open to other people's opinions.

### 2. Respect

Respect is mutual and cannot be just a one-way street.

Value other people's ideas and time, and be fair and courteous in your responses.

Respecting differences and considering more ideas will result in richer perspectives and solutions.

### 3. Trust

Trust comes from keeping your word and acting with integrity.

Strive to trust that other team members will be responsive and that you will be responsive.

Trust is further strengthened by open sharing of information, clarity of responsibility, and acting with good intentions.

## Conduct

1. We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all here.
2. Act kind and courteous to everyone. There is no need to be mean.
3. People have their own ideas and there will always be differences of opinion. There is no right answer. Let's respect each opinion.
4. We will exclude you from the dialogue if you have insulted or harassed anyone.
5. Personal acts of harassment will not be tolerated. If you feel you are being harassed or made to feel uncomfortable by a community member, please contact [**Pulsate Moderation Team**][mod-email].
6. Likewise, any spam, trolling, or emotional language is not welcome.

## Moderation

In the unlikely event that you determine that moderation is required, please contact the [**Pulsate Moderation Team**][mod-email].

1. Statements that violate Pulsate's Code of Conduct, such as malicious or hurtful remarks, will not be tolerated.
2. Any comments deemed inappropriate by the moderators will not be tolerated, regardless of whether or not they are addressed in the Code of Conduct.
3. If you believe that the punishment handed down by a moderator is unjustified, please communicate with another moderator **in private**.
4. Moderators are required to adhere to this code of conduct more heavily than other community members. If a moderator says or does something inappropriate, he or she will be expected to take more severe action than other users.

Please do not touch offensive or sensitive issues in the Pulsate community. This is both for your own protection and the protection of those you care about.

And if someone objects to something you say or do, resist the urge to defend yourself. Stop and apologize for the words and actions that have been pointed out. Remember, it is your responsibility to make sure your people feel comfortable. We are on your side. We are here for you. People will treat you with goodwill as long as they trust you.

This Code of Conduct was established with reference to the [**Code of Conduct for the Programming Language [Rust]**](https://www.rust-lang.org/ja/policies/code-of-conduct).

We take this opportunity to express our utmost appreciation.
