# Project Philosophy

Next-generation distributed SNS that **"redefines"** people's connections.

## Overview

The Pulsate Project is an OSS project to develop a next generation distributed social networking service that is fast and developer friendly.
We believe that existing ActivityPub implementations have potential accessibility and UI/UX issues.
We will **redefine** these distributed SNSs and create a distributed SNS that is easy for everyone to use.

## Redefining People's Connections

Pulsate rethinks the way people share information and communicate easily.
Using ActivityPub and other distributed technologies, Pulsate will create a fairer and more open digital space where people from all over the world can freely connect and express themselves.

## Strengthening the developer community

In the spirit of open source, we will create a system that facilitates developers' participation in development, improve documentation, and manage the community.

## We don't put in anything extra.

We emphasize user-centered design. We provide only what is necessary and avoid bothering the user with superfluous features and information.
We aim not only for simple and intuitive usability, but also for quick and easy access to the information users seek.
